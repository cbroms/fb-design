After nearly 50 years in its Albert Park Lane location, the capacity of WildCare’s physical plant has been stretched to its absolute limit. This project will redevelop the existing Albert Park Lane property, preserving WildCare’s historic location in the heart of the San Rafael community. The beloved historic structure will be relocated to the front of the property and restored and rehabilitated into the Terwilliger Nature Center and educational heart of the site, opening onto a new Ambassador Courtyard.

Wrapping around the back of the site is the new attached three-story animal hospital and office building, with screened animal caging on its roof. Visitors will access the site from a new pedestrian bridge across San Rafael Creek and onto a deck spanning the front of the building and overlooking the creek front.![](/static/img/WildCare_2.jpg){: .big }
