WildCare, with roots stretching back to 1975, is the premier organization for wildlife medicine and environmental education in Northern California today. Since its founding, WildCare has treated and cared for more than 120,000 wild animal patients in its downtown San Rafael urban Wildlife Hospital and more than 1,000,000 children and adults have benefited from WildCare’s environmental education programs.

Centrally located in downtown San Rafael, WildCare provides wildlife information, nature education, medical aid for ill, injured, and orphaned wild animals, and support for people everywhere to live well with wildlife.![](/static/img/WildCare_2.jpg)After nearly 50 years in its Albert Park Lane location, the capacity of WildCare’s physical plant has been stretched to its absolute limit. This project will redevelop the existing Albert Park Lane property, preserving WildCare’s historic location in the heart of the San Rafael community. The beloved historic structure will be relocated to the front of the property and restored and rehabilitated into the Terwilliger Nature Center and educational heart of the site, opening onto a new Ambassador Courtyard.


Wrapping around the back of the site is the new attached three-story animal hospital and office building, with screened animal caging on its roof. Visitors will access the site from a new pedestrian bridge across San Rafael Creek and onto a deck spanning the front of the building and overlooking the creek front.
