The Marin Art and Garden Center, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is a multi-purpose facility, housing a variety of community organizations devoted to gardening, conservation, art and the performing arts. The Master Planning effort included the evaluation of the existing site conditions both built and environmental, operational evaluations and the development of an overall site and building master plan.

The project also included overseeing and leading programming and workshop facilitation. The team then evaluated Phase I options and costs to guide the Center in the selection of the Phase I project and general contractor to partner with them from pre-construction through execution.
