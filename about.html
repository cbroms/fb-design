    Architecture, landscape, and interior design, considered as a seamless whole
  </h2>
  <p>
    Fairchild Broms Design was established in 1995 by Jessica Fairchild and Kai
    Broms as a multi-disciplinary studio focusing on architecture, landscape,
    interiors and product design. Now under the leadership of Jessica Fairchild,
    the firm is based in Marin County California, just north of San Francisco.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fairchild Broms Design is committed to the premise that each project is
    unique and the result is a response that reflects the site, the program and
    the needs of each individual client.

    Jessica Fairchild, AIA, is a licensed architect and has practiced in
    California since 1991. Trained in art and architectural history at UC Santa
    Cruz under mentor Reynar Banham. Ms. Fairchild attended UCLA’s Graduate
    School of Architecture and Urban Planning, earning her master’s degree in
    architecture. Throughout her career she has focused on multi-family housing
    and institutional projects such as libraries, civic buildings and
    streetscapes. She added single-family residential design and landscape
    design to the practice in 2004.

    Ms. Fairchild enjoys the close collaboration that comes with architectural
    practice and the opportunity to engage holistically in a project:
    architecture, landscape and interior design considered as a seamless whole.
    Her work has bridged between historical renovation projects and contemporary
    design and she greatly enjoys working in both aesthetics.
